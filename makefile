# Call with "make all" to rebuild everything, "make clean" to clean everything,
# "make clean_list" to remove all intermediatary files but preserve any binaries,
# "make doxygen" to document everything with Doxygen (if installed) and
# "make clean_doxygen" to remove generated Doxygen documentation from everything.
